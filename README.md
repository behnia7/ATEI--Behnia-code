# ATEI--Behnia-code
This Google Earth Engine script maps Alpine Treeline Ecotones (ATE) using Landsat surface reflectance and elevation data. It computes NDVI, applies cloud masking and spatial smoothing, derives three ecologically meaningful components, and integrates them into a logistic Alpine Treeline Ecotone Index (ATEI) for spatial analysis and export.
